# Call Automation - Multiple Dial Out Sample

In this sample, we cover how you can use Call Automation SDK

### Setup and host your Azure DevTunnel

[Azure DevTunnels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview) is an Azure service that enables you to share local web services hosted on the internet. Use the commands below to connect your local development environment to the public internet. This creates a tunnel with a persistent endpoint URL and which allows anonymous access. We will then use this endpoint to notify your application of calling events from the ACS Call Automation service.

```bash
devtunnel create --allow-anonymous
devtunnel port create -p 8080
devtunnel host
```

### Run the application

- Navigate to the directory containing the pom.xml file and use the following mvn commands:
    - Compile the application: mvn compile
    - Build the package: mvn package
    - Execute the app: mvn exec:java
- Access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
    - Try the GET and POST methods to run the Sample Application
