For full instructions on how to build this code sample from scratch, see [Quickstart: Send an SMS message](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony-sms/send?pivots=programming-language-java).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-jdk-install) version 8 or above.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- An deployed Communication Services resource and connection string. For details, see [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource).
- An SMS enabled telephone number [Get a phone number](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony-sms/get-phone-number?pivots=programming-language-java).
- A setup managed identity for a development environment, [see Authorize access with managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/managed-identity-from-cli).
## Code Structure

- **./send-sms-quickstart/src/main/java/com/communication/quickstart/App.java:** contains code for sending SMS messages.
- **pom.xml:** Project's Project Object Model, or [POM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html).

## Before running sample code

1. Open an instance of PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Command Prompt or equivalent and navigate to the directory that you'd like to clone the sample to.
2. `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-java-quickstarts.git`
3. With the Communication Services procured in pre-requisites, add connection string in the code at line no 24
    ```String connectionString = "ACS_Connection_String";```.
4.  With the SMS enabled telephone number procured in pre-requisites, add it to the **App.java** file. Assign your ACS telephone number and sender numbers at line 46 and 47.

## Run the code

1. Navigate to the directory containing the pom.xml file and compile the project by using command `mvn compile`.
2. Build the package using command `mvn package`.
3. Run the command to execute the app `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.communication.quickstart.App" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false`.
