# Call Automation - Quick Start Sample

In this quickstart, we cover how you can use Call Automation SDK to make an outbound call to a phone number and use the newly announced integration with Azure AI services to play dynamic prompts to participants using Text-to-Speech and recognize user voice input through Speech-to-Text to drive business logic in your application. 

# Design

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- A deployed Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource).
- A [phone number](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number) in your Azure Communication Services resource that can make outbound calls. NB: phone numbers are not available in free subscriptions.
- Create Azure AI Multi Service resource. For details, see [Create an Azure AI Multi service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK) Microsoft.OpenJDK.17](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Create and host a Azure Dev Tunnel. Instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started)
- (Optional) A Microsoft Teams user with a phone license that is `voice` enabled. Teams phone license is required to add Teams users to the call. Learn more about Teams licenses [here](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-bundle-options).  Learn about enabling phone system with `voice` [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/setting-up-your-phone-system).   You also need to complete the prerequisite step [Authorization for your Azure Communication Services Resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/how-tos/call-automation/teams-interop-call-automation?pivots=programming-language-javascript#step-1-authorization-for-your-azure-communication-services-resource-to-enable-calling-to-microsoft-teams-users) to enable calling to Microsoft Teams users.

## Before running the sample for the first time

- Open the application.yml file in the resources folder to configure the following settings

    - `connectionstring`: Azure Communication Service resource's connection string.
    - `callerphonenumber`: Phone number associated with the Azure Communication Service resource.
    - `targetphonenumber`: Target Phone number.

      Format: "OutboundTarget(Phone Number)".

          For e.g. "+1425XXXAAAA"
    - `basecallbackuri`: Base url of the app. For local development use dev tunnel url.
    - `cognitiveServiceEndpoint`: Cognitive Service Endpoint.
    - `targetTeamsUserId`: (Optional) update field with the Microsoft Teams user Id you would like to add to the call. See [Use Graph API to get Teams user Id](../../../how-tos/call-automation/teams-interop-call-automation.md#step-2-use-the-graph-api-to-get-microsoft-entra-object-id-for-teams-users-and-optionally-check-their-presence).  Uncomment the below snippet in ProgramSample.java to enable Teams Interop scenario.
      ```
      client.getCallConnection(callConnectionId).addParticipant(
                        new CallInvite(new MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier(appConfig.getTargetTeamsUserId()))
                                .setSourceDisplayName("Jack (Contoso Tech Support)"));
      ```

### Setup and host your Azure DevTunnel

[Azure DevTunnels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview) is an Azure service that enables you to share local web services hosted on the internet. Use the commands below to connect your local development environment to the public internet. This creates a tunnel with a persistent endpoint URL and which allows anonymous access. We will then use this endpoint to notify your application of calling events from the ACS Call Automation service.

```bash
devtunnel create --allow-anonymous
devtunnel port create -p 8080
devtunnel host
```

### Run the application

- Navigate to the directory containing the pom.xml file and use the following mvn commands:
    - Compile the application: mvn compile
    - Build the package: mvn package
    - Execute the app: mvn exec:java
- Access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
    - Try the GET /outboundCall to run the Sample Application
