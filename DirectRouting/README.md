# Direct Routing Configuration

For full instructions on how to build this code sample from scratch, look at [Quickstart: Direct Routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony-sms/voice-routing-sdk-config?pivots=programming-language-java)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-jdk-install) version 8 or above
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- A deployed Communication Services resource and connection string. For details, see [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource).
- Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and port number of a Session Border Controller (SBC) in operational telephony system.
- [Verified domain name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/how-tos/telephony/domain-validation) of the SBC FQDN.

## Code Structure

- **./src/main/java/com/communication/quickstart/App.java:** contains code for managing phone numbers.
- **pom.xml:** Project's Project Object Model, or [POM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html).

## Before running sample code

1. Open an instance of PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Command Prompt or equivalent and navigate to the directory that you'd like to clone the sample to.
2. `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-java-quickstarts.git`
3.  With the Communication Services procured in pre-requisites, add connection string in the code at line no 13
    ```String connectionString = "https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com/;accesskey=<ACCESS_KEY>";```. 
4. Replace FQDNs of contoso.com domain with your FQDNs


## Run the code

1. Navigate to the directory containing the pom.xml file and compile the project by using command `mvn clean compile`.
2. Then, build the package using command `mvn package`.
3. Run the command to execute the app `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.communication.quickstart.App" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false`.
